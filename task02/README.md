**Deadline: March 4th (Thu) at 15:00pm**

----

## Before Doing Assignment

If you have not done the [task00](../task00), do it first to set up the C++ graphics development environment.

Follow [this document](../doc/submit.md) to submit the assignment, In a nutshell, before doing the assignment,

- install `eigen` library following  [this document](../doc/setup_eigen.md)
- make sure you synchronized the `main ` branch of your local repository  to that of remote repository.
- make sure you created branch `task02` from `main` branch.
- make sure you are currently in the `task02` branch (use `git branch -a` command).

Now you are ready to go!

## Problem 1

1. Build the code using `cmake`
2. Run the code
3. Take a screenshot image (looks like image at the top)
4. Save the screenshot image overwriting `task02/problem1.png`

You will see many particles bump into a ball.

## Problem 2

Let's simulate [Brownian motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion).  

Follow the instruction at `line #49`  in [main.cpp](main.cpp) to modify the code to simulate the collision between the ball and a particle. 

After running the program for a while, save the screenshot image overwriting `task02/problem2.png`
